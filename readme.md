We have a form on our wordpress website at https://www.domeshelter.com.au/request-quote

After modifying the form from its previous design the conversion rate went from 17% to 37%, a great improvement.

We wonder if there is a way to improve the response and engagement rate even further by improving the graphical design of the form to make it more appealing to engage with.

This competition is to find a new form design, using the exact same form fields, that may help to improve the look and appeal of the form.

It will be important to keep the company branding style and colours shown on the rest of the website.

We would be pleased to hear from designers who can show us an alternative design.

Please contact us if you need further information.
